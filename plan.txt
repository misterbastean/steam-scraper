A web scraper that collects data from Steam's sales and updates a database. This will be used as a backend
for a webapp that displays price data over time, as well as allowing users to setup alerts for when a specific
game is being sold under a specified price.


Plan
1. Query the Steam store sales page (https://store.steampowered.com/search/?specials=1&page=x where "x" is the page number)
2. Parse using BeautifulSoup to pull out the data (see model below)
3. Save to database
4. This will need to be in a loop that goes through each page of the sales store.
    4a. This will likely require try/except because of variable numbers of pages
